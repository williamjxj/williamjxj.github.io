# William Jiang Portfolio - Design Brainstorming

## Approach 1: "Neural Networks" - Tech-Forward Minimalism
**Probability: 0.08**

**Design Movement:** Cyberpunk Minimalism meets Corporate Tech

**Core Principles:**
- Geometric precision with subtle neon accents
- Information density balanced with breathing room
- Dark mode as primary aesthetic
- Emphasis on data visualization and technical credibility

**Color Philosophy:**
Primary palette: Deep charcoal (#0a0e27), electric cyan (#00d9ff), vibrant purple (#7c3aed)
The dark background conveys sophistication and technical depth. Cyan and purple accents create energy without chaos, reflecting AI's cutting-edge nature. Neon-like glows subtly highlight interactive elements.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Asymmetric grid with floating cards. Hero section spans full width with diagonal accent. Content flows in staggered columns. Sidebar for navigation with smooth transitions.

**Signature Elements:**
- Animated neural network background (subtle, non-distracting)
- Glowing accent borders on project cards
- Gradient text for key headings
- Animated skill tags with hover effects

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Smooth transitions, hover states reveal more information. Cards lift on hover. Scroll-triggered animations. Interactive skill matrix showing expertise levels.

**Animation:**
- Fade-in on scroll for sections
- Smooth color transitions on hover
- Subtle pulse effects on accent elements
- Parallax scrolling for depth

**Typography System:**
- Display: Sora Bold (geometric, modern) for headings
- Body: Inter Regular for content
- Accent: IBM Plex Mono for code/tech terms
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem → 2.5rem → 1.5rem → 1rem

## Approach 2: "Craft & Code" - Warm Minimalism with Personality
**Probability: 0.07**

**Design Movement:** Brutalist Design meets Warm Modernism

**Core Principles:**
- Authentic, handmade feel with clean typography
- Warm neutral palette with strategic color pops
- Emphasis on readability and storytelling
- Celebrates both technical and human sides

**Color Philosophy:**
Primary palette: Warm cream (#faf8f3), charcoal (#1a1a1a), burnt orange (#c85a17), sage green (#6b8e71)
Warm tones create approachability while maintaining professionalism. Burnt orange and sage green represent creativity and growth. The palette feels curated, not corporate.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Generous whitespace with asymmetric sections. Large typography as design element. Content blocks with subtle borders. Timeline-style project showcase with alternating left-right layout.

**Signature Elements:**
- Hand-drawn style accent lines
- Serif typography for headings (Georgia or similar)
- Textured background patterns (subtle grain)
- Project cards with image overlays and detailed descriptions

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Thoughtful hover states that reveal context. Smooth scroll behaviors. Cards expand to show more details. Emphasis on reading experience over flashiness.

**Animation:**
- Gentle fade-ins on scroll
- Smooth expand/collapse for sections
- Underline animations on links
- Subtle scale transforms on hover

**Typography System:**
- Display: Georgia Bold for headings (serif warmth)
- Body: Segoe UI or system font for clarity
- Accent: Courier New for code snippets
- Hierarchy: 3rem → 2.2rem → 1.3rem → 1rem

## Approach 3: "AI Momentum" - Bold Gradient Modernism
**Probability: 0.06**

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Tech + Motion Design

**Core Principles:**
- Dynamic gradients and bold color transitions
- Heavy use of motion and micro-interactions
- Modern, energetic visual language
- Showcases AI capabilities through visual effects

**Color Philosophy:**
Primary palette: Deep navy (#0f172a), vibrant blue (#3b82f6), electric magenta (#ec4899), lime green (#84cc16)
Bold gradients flow from blue → magenta → green, representing AI's transformative power. High contrast ensures readability while maintaining visual excitement.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Full-bleed sections with gradient backgrounds. Hero section with animated gradient mesh. Cards with gradient borders. Diagonal sections and angled transitions between content blocks.

**Signature Elements:**
- Animated gradient mesh background
- Glowing gradient text for headlines
- Animated skill bubbles with interconnected lines
- Project showcase with video backgrounds or animated overlays

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Highly interactive with immediate visual feedback. Hover states trigger animations. Scroll reveals progressive animations. Cursor interactions create visual trails.

**Animation:**
- Animated gradient shifts on scroll
- Particle effects on hover
- Staggered animations for list items
- Smooth morphing shapes in background

**Typography System:**
- Display: Poppins Bold for headings (modern, friendly)
- Body: Poppins Regular for content
- Accent: JetBrains Mono for code
- Hierarchy: 3.8rem → 2.4rem → 1.4rem → 1rem
